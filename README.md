# Damped-Track-Script
A script to automatically add the damped track bone constraint on the selected bones

To change the stiffness of the chain, simply edit the number after constraint.influence. 

A high number like 0.9 or 1, will equate to a very loose chain.

While a low number such as 0.2 or 0.1, will have a subtle effect, giving it the appearance of a very stiff chain.
